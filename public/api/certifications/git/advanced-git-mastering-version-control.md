In November 2020, I earned a certificate from a comprehensive Git course taught by Mosh Hamedani. Throughout the course, I gained in-depth knowledge and skills in fundamental concepts, creating snapshots, browsing project history, branching and merging, collaborating using GitHub, and rewriting history.
