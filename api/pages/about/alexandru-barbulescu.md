## About recent project:

Recently I've finished a project for a medical company.

My responsabilities in this project it was the Frontend part and to make sure that everything will be implemented using a clean arhitecture, tools and best practices for efficient and maintainable codebase.

In this project we had used [React](https://google.com) with [TypeScript](https://google.com) and using the idiomatic practices such as:

- Functional Components
- Using TSX (TypeScript XML)

## Used tech-stack:

- [ViteJS](https://google.com) (for React with TypeScript): A modern build tool that is used for developing web applications using modern web technologies such as Vue.js, React
- [Husky](https://google.com): A tool for running custom scripts automatically when certain Git events occur, such as committing or pushing changes.
- [Prettier](https://google.com): A code formatter that helps maintain consistent code style and formatting across our codebase.
- [TS Prune](https://google.com): A tool for detecting and removing unused TypeScript exports, which can help optimize our codebase.
- [Linter](https://google.com): A tool for finding potential bugs and errors in our code by analyzing its syntax and structure.
- [Depcheck](https://google.com): A tool for detecting and removing unused and deprecated dependencies, which can help keep our codebase lean and efficient.
- [Jest](https://google.com) + [React Testing Library](https://google.com): A testing suite for running automated tests on our React components and applications, which can help catch bugs and regressions early in the development cycle.
