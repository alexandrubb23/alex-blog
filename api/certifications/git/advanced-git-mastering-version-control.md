In November 2020, I earned a certificate from a comprehensive `Advanced Git: Mastering Version Control` course taught by [Mosh Hamedani](https://twitter.com/moshhamedani). Throughout the course, I gained in-depth knowledge and skills in fundamental concepts, creating snapshots, browsing project history, branching and merging, collaborating using GitHub, and rewriting history.
