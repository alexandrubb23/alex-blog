          When I&apos;m not writing software, I dedicate time to training in¬†
          <strong>Hakko Denshin Ryu Jujutsu</strong>, a traditional Japanese
          martial art. I&apos;m honored to hold two dan ranks, and I proudly
          wear them in recognition of the discipline and growth this journey has
          brought me.

          Beyond martial arts and software, I have a deep passion for classic
          arcade gaming. I&apos;ve built an impressive collection of consoles
          and games over the years‚Äîincluding legendary systems like the Sega
          Genesis, Sony PlayStation (PSX), Nintendo Entertainment System (NES),
          Super Nintendo (SNES), and the iconic Neo Geo.

          inspire.
